Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[39]

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[40] They called this new technology PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site.[41][42]

Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[43][44][45] Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word "googol",[46][47] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[48] Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu.[49][50]

The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[51] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[39]) in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[39][52][53]
